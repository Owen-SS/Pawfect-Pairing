## Introduction

This purpose of this web app is to pair people with the dog breed which suits them best. There is a very large range of different dog breeds which have different needs. Some breeds require more walking, some are better for work and some are just lap dogs. This app helps you make the best decision not just for you but for the dog you get! 

Please note, the goal for this project was to dedicate only one weekend to see how much progress we could make. - This is our first time using React Native, it is a very new technology to us.

## Requirements:

### Must-haves
- Dog name
- Dog image
- Dog sescription
- Swiping functionality -
   - Swipe left - don‚Äôt like, not interested
   - Swipe right - do like, my cup of tea
   - Swipe up - save, I want to look more into doggo 
- Burger menu which opens up to show dogs that have been saved and swiped right on
- After 20 dogs have been passed through interest gives an overall result on what dog suits the person
- Cross functionally where the person is asked specific questions, maybe like 10/20 once all have been answered via multiple choice it also gives the breed which suits the person

### Should-haves
- Once the person has gotten their result if they are happy with it an option should come up like view this breed in the RSPCA or any other dog rescue company.
